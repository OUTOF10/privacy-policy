<strong>Privacy Policy</strong>
  <p>At Outof10, accessible from <a href="https://outof10.github.io/privacy-policy/">https://outof10.github.io/privacy-policy</a>, one of our main priorities is the privacy of our visitors. This Privacy Policy document contains types of information that is collected and recorded by Outof10 and how we use it.</p>
  <p>If you have additional questions or require more information about our Privacy Policy, do not hesitate to contact us.</p>
  <p>This Privacy Policy applies only to our online activities and is valid for visitors to our Application with regards to the information that they shared and/or collect in Outof10. This policy is not applicable to any information collected offline or via channels other than this Application.</p>

<strong>Consent</strong>
  <p>By using our Application, you hereby consent to our Privacy Policy and agree to its terms.</p>

<h2>Information collection and Use</h2>
  <p>While using our Service, We may ask you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information that can be used to contact or identify you. Personally identifiable information may include, but is not limited to, your phone number (“Personal Information“).</p>

<h2>Cookies</h2>
  <p>Cookies are files with small amount of data, which may include an anonymous unique identifier. Cookies are sent to your phone from an app and stored on your phone. </p>
  <p>I use cookies to collect information. You can clear such information by clearing the data or cache of the app from the Application Settings of your phone. However, if you clear these, you may not be able to enjoy the full effect of the applications. </p>
  
<h2>Service Providers</h2>
  <p>We may employ third party companies and individuals to facilitate my Service, to provide the Service on our behalf, to perform Service-related services or to assist us in analyzing how my Service is used.</p>
  <p>These third parties may have access to your Personal Information only to perform these tasks on my behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose.</p>
  
  <p>Links to privacy policies of third party service providers used in our app:</P>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Google Play Services</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://airtable.com/privacy">Airtable</a></li>
  </ul>
  
<h2>Security</h2>
  <P>The security of your Personal Information is important to us, but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, We cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>

<h2>Links To Other Sites/Services</h2>
  <p>My Service may contain links to other sites that are not operated by me. If you click on a third party link, you will be directed to that third party’s site. I strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of every site you visit or app you install. </p>
  <p>I have no control over, and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies or practices of any third party sites or services.</p>

<h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>While our Services do not generally address anyone under the age of 13 (“Children” or “Child”), in the case a particular app can be accessed by children below this age, this will be duly communicated in the content ratings of the app.</p>
  <p>We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your Child has provided us with Personal Information, please contact us. If we discover that a Child under 13 has provided us with Personal Information, We will try to delete such information from our servers at the earliest. However, We cannot guarantee the deletion of data, since backups of data by us (i.e.,Outof10) or by third parties involved in providing the Service may still remain.</p>

<h2>Changes To this Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.</p>
  <p>You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.</p>
